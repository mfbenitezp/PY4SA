Welcome to the handbook for the second part of the module **GG3209 Spatial Analysis with GIS**. This part of this module is about Python and how we can use this powerful programming language to deal and analyse spatial data, weather is in Vector or Raster format. While in the first part of the GG3209 module you were mostly focus in the use of QGIS (ADD LINK) the powerful and open source GIS tool to work with spatial data, however in this part we will cover an introduction to Python, and its use for manipulation of spatial data and deployment of spatial analysis models. 

Python has been multiple times catalogued as the one of the most popular programming technologies and it is widely used as a scripting language in the GIScience world. Students will learn how to set up their own development environment with a popular tool called Jupyter Notebooks, then learn how to manipulate vector and raster data and finish with running clustering methods, as a useful methodology for dissertations.  

# Content

Introduction to Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and GIT 
- Working with tabular and spatial data in Python 
- Clustering models 
This part will stablish a comprehensive introduction to Python (an easy to learn and powerful 
development programming language) and its use for manipulation of spatial data and deployment of 
spatial analysis models. Python has been multiple times catalogued as the one of the most popular 
programming technologies and it is widely used as a scripting language in the GIScience world. 
Students will learn how to set up their own development environment with a popular tool called 
3 
Jupyter Notebooks, then learn how to manipulate vector and raster data and finish with running 
clustering methods, as a useful methodology for dissertations.
